Color ReadELF output (creadelf)
***********************************

USAGE: ([...=...]: optional argument with default value)

    $ creadelf [option = -a] file


This tool colors the output of readelf to enhance readability.

The colors used are tunable in the script itself. Default colors are:

- green for addresses like 0xc0ffee or 003a9e4080a0
- cyan background for timestamps (2013-01-05T18:22:31)
- red for SO names (libc.so.6)
- blue for SYMBOLS (like GNU_STACK)
- cyan for symbol table entries (fclose or abort@GLIBC_2.2.5)
- magenta for section names (.interp)

The program is (obviously) written in Perl and uses (obviously) Perl's
Regex engine.

The colored output may have little mistakes, e.g. not matched function names etc.,
but it should work fine all in all.

This program should work fine with the output of GNU readelf on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD with
ELFs from both platforms.
